# V2Ray Docker Compose

This repository contains sample Docker Compose files to run V2Ray upstream and bridge servers.

> **Note**
> If you need to manage your users and their usage, I recommend to see [Outline Bridge Server](https://github.com/miladrahimi/outline-bridge-server) repository.

## Documentation

### Terminology

* Upstream Server: A server that has free access to the Internet.
* Bridge Server: A server that is available to clients and has access to the upstream server.
* Client: A user-side application with access to the bridge server.

```
(Client) <-> [ Bridge Server ] <-> [ Upstream Server ] <-> (Internet)
```

### Setup

#### Upstream Server

1. Install Docker and Docker-compose.
1. Copy the `v2ray-upstream-server` directory into the upstream server.
1. Run ```cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid``` command to generate a UUID.
1. Replace `<UPSTREAM-UUID>` in the `config/config.json` file with the generated UUID.
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`.

#### Bridge Server

1. Install Docker and Docker-compose.
1. Copy the `v2ray-bridge-server` directory into the bridge server.
1. Replace the following variables in the `config/config.json` file with appropriate values.
    * `<SHADOWSOCKS-PASSWORD>`: A password for Shadowsocks users like `FR33DoM`.
    * `<BRIDGE-UUID>`: A new UUID for bridge server (Run ```cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid```).
    * `<UPSTREAM-IP>`: The upstream server IP address like `13.13.13.13`.
    * `<UPSTREAM-UUID>`: The generated UUID for the upstream server.
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`. 
1. (Optional) You can run `./v2ray-bridge-server/clients.py` to generate client configurations and links.
1. (Optional) You can serve `./v2ray-bridge-server/web/index.html` to help your users.

#### Clients

##### Shadowsocks Protocol

Shadowsocks is a popular proxy protocol with a variety of client applications.
We recommend these client applications:
* [Outline](https://getoutline.org/get-started/#step-3)
* [Shadowsocks for macOS](https://github.com/shadowsocks/ShadowsocksX-NG/releases)
* [Shadowsocks for Linux](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev)
* [Shadowsocks for Windows](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows/releases)
* [Shadowsocks for Android](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-android/releases)
* [ShadowLink for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shadowlink-shadowsocks-vpn/id1439686518)

You can configure your client application using these settings:

```
IP Address: <BRIDGE-IP>
Port: 1210
Encryption/Method/Algorithm: aes-128-gcm
Password: <SHADOWSOCKS-PASSWORD>
```

##### VMESS Protocol

The VMESS proxy protocol is the primary protocol that V2Ray servers provide.
We recommend these client applications:
* [V2RayX for macOS](https://github.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX/releases)
* [v2ray-core for Linux](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core)
* [Qv2ray for Windows](https://qv2ray.net)
* [ShadowLink for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shadowlink-shadowsocks-vpn/id1439686518)
* [v2rayNG for Android](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayNG)

You can configure your client application using these settings:

```
IP Address: <BRIDGE-IP>
Port: 1310
ID/UUID/UserID: <BRIDGE-UUID>
Alter ID: 0
Level: 0
Security/Method/Encryption: aes-128-gcm
Network: TCP
```
