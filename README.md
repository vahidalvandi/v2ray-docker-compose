# V2Ray Docker Compose

This repository introduces V2Ray-based solutions to bypass limitations in highly restricted networks
without direct/safe/stable access to upstream servers (servers with access to free Internet).

## Server Solutions

### V2Ray Upsream and Relay Servers

In this solution, you need these two servers:

* Upstream Server: A server that has access to the free Internet.
* Relay Server: A server with access to the upstream server and available to clients.

```
(Client) <-> [ Relay Server ] <-> [ Upstream Server ] <-> (Internet)
```

This solution consists of two steps and provides VMESS and Shadowsocks (AEAD) protocols.

Step 1: Setup Upstream Server

1. Install Docker and Docker-compose.
1. Copy the `v2ray-upstream-server` and the `utils` directories into the upstream server.
1. Run ```./utils/bbr.sh``` to speed up server network.
1. Run ```cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid``` in your terminal to generate a UUID.
1. Replace `<UPSTREAM-UUID>` in `v2ray/config/config.json` with the generated UUID.
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`.

Step 2: Setup Relay Server

1. Install Docker and Docker-compose.
1. Copy the `v2ray-relay-server` and the `utils` directories into the relay server.
1. Run ```./utils/bbr.sh``` to speed up server network.
1. Replace the following variables in `v2ray/config/config.json` with appropriate values.
    * `<SHADOWSOCKS-PASSWORD>`: A password for Shadowsocks users like `FR33DoM`.
    * `<BRIDGE-UUID>`: A new UUID for relay server (Run ```cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid```).
    * `<UPSTREAM-IP>`: The upstream server IP address (like `13.13.13.13`).
    * `<UPSTREAM-UUID>`: The upstream server UUID from the previous step.
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`.
1. Run `./clients.py` to generate client configurations and links.

### V2Ray Behind a CDN Service

In this solution, you need one server (upstream) and a domain/subdomain added to a CDN service.

* Upstream Server: A server that has free access to the Internet.
* CDN Service: A Content delivery network like [Cloudflare](//cloudflare.com), [ArvanCloud](//arvancloud.ir) or [DerakCloud](//derak.cloud).

```
(Client) <-> [ CDN Service ] <-> [ Upstream Server ] <-> (Internet)
```

This solution provides VMESS over Websockets + TLS + CDN.

Follow these steps to set up V2Ray + Caddy (Web server) + CDN:

1. In your CDN, create an `A` record pointing to your server IP with the proxy option turned off.
1. Install Docker and Docker-compose on your server.
1. Copy the `v2ray-caddy-cdn` and the `utils` directories into the server.
1. Run ```./utils/bbr.sh``` to speed up server network.
1. Run ```cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid``` to generate a UUID.
1. Replace `<UPSTREAM-UUID>` in `v2ray/config/config.json` with the generated UUID.
1. Replace `<EXAMPLE.COM>` in `caddy/Caddyfile` with your domain/subdomain.
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`.
1. Visit your domain/subdomain in your web browser.
   Wait until the [homepage](https://github.com/miladrahimi/v2ray-docker-compose/blob/master/v2ray-caddy-cdn/caddy/web/index.html) is loaded.
1. (Optional) In your CDN, turn the proxy option on for the record.
1. Run `./vmess.py` to generate client configuration (link).

If you prefer NGINX as the web server, read [V2RAY_NGINX_CDN](docs/V2RAY_NGINX_CDN.md) instead.

Some CDN services don't offer unlimited traffic for free plans.
Please check [CDN Free Plans](https://github.com/miladrahimi/v2ray-docker-compose/discussions/89).

You don't need to turn the cloud (proxy) on in your CDN (step 10) when the Internet is not blocked.
When it's off, clients connect to the server directly and CDN services also don't charge you any fee.
